What Rowe put on G-Chat:
So on the tips sheet I gave you, I said regenerate your openssl keys.
You should ALSO regenerate your SSH keys
As they will be giving you CLONED images.
Which means if ANY team gets breached, they have ALL your private keys for EVERY system.
So if it has a crypto key, you reset it.
You should also look up how to reset the Master KDC Windows key, because same reason - one team gets breached and you will get pwned because you have the same keys for AD
