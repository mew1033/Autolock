        <span class="heading1">Introduction to External Applications</span></p>
    <p>
        External applications can help you get things done that can&#39;t be done in 
        mRemote.<br />
        You can for example start a CMD Console or launch your favorite FTP tool from 
        within mRemote.<br />
        This wouldn&#39;t make much sense by itself because you can already launch your 
        applications by using the Windows Start Menu, Quick Launch or whatever you 
        prefer to use 
        to start your apps.</p>
    <p>
        But there&#39;s more!</p>
    <p>
        In mRemote you can launch applications and tell them what to do with the use of 
        arguments (parameters) and variables of the currently selected Connection.<br />
        You can for example select your home router&#39;s SSH Connection entry and do a 
        traceroute (tracert) on that host.</p>
    <p>
        This is much more comfortable and powerful than opening the console and typing 
        tracert YourHost.</p>
<p class="heading4">
        Notes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Throught this document I will refer to External Applications as Ext. apps or 
        Ext. app.</li>
    <li>Ext. apps are stored in c:\documents and settings\username\local 
        settings\application data\Felix_Deimel\mRemote\extApps.xml</li>
</ul>
<p>
    <span class="heading1">Variables</span></p>
    <p>
        Variables and arguments can be used to tell the ext. app what to do.<br />
        Here&#39;s a list of variables currently supported by mRemote:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>%Name%</li>
        <li>%Hostname%</li>
        <li>%Port%</li>
        <li>%Username%</li>
        <li>%Password%</li>
        <li>%Domain%</li>
        <li>%Description%</li>
        <li>%MacAddress%</li>
        <li>%UserField%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The variables always refer to the currently selected Connection.</p>
    <p>
        <span class="heading1">Example</span></p>
    <p>
        First of all start the Ext. Apps management interface. To do this click Tools in the main menu and 
        select External Applications.<br />
        You will see a screen like on the following screenshot.</p>
<p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/01.png" /></p>
<p>
        The fields below the list are greyed out because you haven&#39;t created a Ext. App 
        entry yet.<br />
        To create one right click the blank area in the list and select Add like in the 
        screenshot below.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/02.png" /></p>
    <p>
        This is what you&#39;ll get:</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/03.png" /></p>
    <p>
        So the three fields are now available and need to be filled.<br />
        The Display Name is simply the name you will see when you want to launch that 
        application, so give it a descriptive name.<br />
        I named mine Traceroute as I will create a Ext. App launcher that will do a 
        tracert command in the console.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/04.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Ok, the next thing we&#39;ll need is a filename. This is the application that we 
        want to be executed.<br />
        I simply type in cmd for a windows cmd console.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/05.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Now the fun part comes in - the arguments.<br />
        The windows cmd has a command line argument that tells the console to launch the 
        command followed by that argument and stay open.<br />
        It&#39;s /K. (There&#39;s also /C, this is useful when you want the console to close 
        after the command was executed)<br />
        In this case I&#39;ll use /K as I want to scan through the result when the command 
        completes.<br />
        After that I just type tracert %HostName%. This tells the console to do a 
        traceroute on the hostname of the currently selected Connection.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/06.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Alright! That&#39;s all we&#39;ll need.<br />
        Now right click one of you connections, click Tools, External Applications 
        and select Traceroute.</p>
    <p>
        <img alt="" src="Screenshots/External%20Apps/07.png" /></p>
    <p>
        Voilà! A console window will popup and execute your tracert command.</p>
    <p>
